# Patch status

Apply with `scripts/apply-patches.sh`. Reverse with
`scripts/apply-patches.sh --reverse`. The submodules in git stay at the
upstream commits; the patches are the delta.

## Verified on this Linux VM

- `tools/vk-requirements` rebuilt from the current source and run against
  lavapipe (`/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.json`, Mesa 25.2.8, LLVM
  20.1.2). Exit 0. `summary hard_fail=0 optional_missing=3
  selected=llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits)`. The three optional misses
  are fragment shader barycentric, `VK_EXT_image_view_min_lod`, and
  `depthBounds`. `VK_KHR_swapchain` is reported as the extension only; no
  surface was created. `VK_EXT_metal_surface` is absent on this host.
  Stock and portability instance enumerations both see one device.
  `VK_KHR_portability_subset` is not advertised, so the portability-subset
  device path was not exercised.
- `patches/madeira/0003-winevulkan-moltenvk.patch` contains
  `moltenvk_static_loader.c`. `tools/checks/test_moltenvk_loader` compiles
  that file and checks the static-link fallback: a missing
  `libMoltenVK.dylib` resolves `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and
  `vkGetDeviceProcAddr` from the process, and does not resolve other
  symbols. That is the loader policy. It is not a MoltenVK build and not
  an iOS link.
- AnyPS5 Linux Release build (`scripts/m0-build-anyps5.sh`) finished and
  linked the relinker. The 17 synthetic tests in
  `core/relinker/relinker/tests/` all passed against that binary. No title
  ELF was used.

## Compiled inside the Linux AnyPS5 build

- `patches/anyps5/0002-vulkan-portability.patch` is in
  `VulkanDevice.cpp.o` and in `libSceAgcDriver.prx`. The object file
  contains the strings `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` and
  `VK_KHR_portability_subset`. `libSceAgcDriver` is `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`;
  the default `m0` build does not emit it, and a follow-up
  `cmake --build build/anyps5 --target libSceAgcDriver` did. Nothing
  created a `VkDevice` from that library on this run. The patch enables
  the two extensions only when the ICD advertises them.
- `patches/anyps5/0001-guest-arena-lazy.patch`: `GuestArena.cpp` compiled
  into `libc.prx` on Linux. The Windows constructor, including
  `ReadArenaLimits` and the lazy `Reserve` loop, is under `#ifdef _WIN32`,
  so the Release Linux object does not contain the `APS5_GUEST_ARENA_*`
  strings (the unused static parser is optimized out). The Linux
  constructor still compiles and leaves the arena unavailable.

## Compile-checked only as a translation unit, not linked into a PE

- A separate `g++ -c` of `GuestArena.cpp` as a Linux TU
  (`-Wno-unused-function`, because the parser is only called from the
  Windows constructor) keeps the `APS5_GUEST_ARENA_*` strings.
- MinGW `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -c` of the same file type-checks the
  Windows constructor, the chunk reserve loop, and the env parser.
  `WindowsMappings.hpp` is included. That object contains the
  `APS5_GUEST_ARENA_*` strings. No `VirtualAlloc` call was executed.
  Pre-existing `-Wcast-function-type` warnings in `WindowsMappings.hpp`
  (GetProcAddress casts) are upstream, not from this patch, and the
  compile is not `-Werror`.

## Reviewed against the pinned sources, not compiled

- The rest of `0003` (`vulkan_ios.c`, `vulkan_metal_ios.c`, the
  `build.sh` / `driver_ios.c` edits) includes Wine unix headers and is
  built by Madeira's iOS `xcrun` script. Those TUs were not compiled here.
- `patches/madeira/0001-fexbridge-avx.patch` edits `FEXBridge.mm`. That
  file includes Mach and FEX headers and is Objective-C++. It was not
  compiled. The behavior it encodes: `MADEIRA_FEX_AVX=0` disables AVX;
  any other value, including unset, enables it; `SupportsSVE128` and
  `SupportsSVE256` stay false. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for
  why SVE is not required and why `xtajit64` is a second switch.
- `patches/madeira/0002-extended-virtual-addressing.patch` adds one plist
  key. It does not sign a profile and does not change the address map.

## Untested, and not claimed

- iOS app link of MoltenVK into `libwin32u_unix.a`.
- `vkCreateMetalSurfaceEXT` against a real `CAMetalLayer`.
- Lazy GuestArena under Wine's `MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER` implementation.
  AnyPS5 already uses placeholder reservations; Wine on iOS may reject
  them. That would be an M4 failure to record, not something this patch
  papers over.
- AVX2 correctness for PS5 code on 128-bit FEX IR.
- Whether a 512 GB iOS map can hold the default 448 GiB arena even with
  the entitlement. Prefer lazy mode and a smaller
  `APS5_GUEST_ARENA_SIZE` until a device log says otherwise.
- AnyPS5's Windows PE actually loading `vulkan-1.dll` from Madeira's
  arm64ec farm. `build/wine-pe/build-modules.sh` grows that farm when
  `MADEIRA_WITH_VULKAN=1`. The script was not run (it needs llvm-mingw
  and a macOS or cross setup Madeira documents).

## Next steps

1. On an Apple Silicon Mac, build MoltenVK, point `vk-requirements` at it,
   and write down every `HARD` failure. That list is the M3 exit criterion.
2. On a Mac with the iOS SDK, `MADEIRA_WITH_VULKAN=1
   build/win32u-unix/build.sh` and fix the first compile error in
   `vulkan_metal_ios.c`. Then link a MoltenVK archive and confirm
   `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "vkGetInstanceProcAddr")` in the app.
3. Build the AnyPS5 Windows PE with a MinGW new enough for upstream
   (BUILD.md asks for MinGW-w64 GCC 15.2.0; this VM has 13.2) and boot it
   under Wine on Windows or under FEX+Wine on ARM64 Linux.
4. Sign a profile that grants extended virtual addressing and read
   `EntitlementChecker`'s `address-map` line.
5. Boot a tiny AnyPS5 PE (no title assets) with `MADEIRA_FEX_AVX=1` and
   `APS5_GUEST_ARENA_LAZY=1` and capture the first exception.
